# Collectibles Registry (Separate Project)

## Concept
Blockchain-based inventory system for graded collectibles

## Features Brainstorm
- Mint NFTs representing graded coins/bars
- Integration with PCGS/NGC certification
- Ownership history tracking
- Digital vault management
- Insurance integration

## Status: IDEA PHASE
Will start AFTER PhoenixPME MVP launch

## Timeline
- **Target**: Post-MVP (after March 6, 2026)
- **Prerequisite**: PhoenixPME auction platform stable
- **Dependencies**: NFT smart contracts, grading API integrations

## Why Separate?
- Avoids feature creep in MVP
- Focuses current development on core auction functionality
- Allows specialized development later
