# coreum-pme: Phoenix Precious Metals Exchange - Manifesto

## The Problem
The current system for trading physical precious metals is broken:
- 15%+ fees on platforms like eBay
- Manipulated paper prices on COMEX/LBMA
- Dealers offering $10-15 below spot
- No liquidity for 90% constitutional silver
- Centralized control and censorship

## Our Vision
A sovereign, peer-to-peer marketplace for physical precious metals where:
- Sellers set their own minimum prices
- Buyers bid directly with any digital asset
- All trades are final and transparent
- Reputation is immutable and on-chain
- No centralized intermediary takes a cut

## Core Principles
1. **Zero Custody**: The protocol never holds user assets
2. **Sovereign Price Discovery**: Value set by auction, not external oracles
3. **Finality & Accountability**: Immutable on-chain feedback
4. **Incentive-Led Security**: Good behavior rewarded, bad behavior penalized

## Technology Stack
- **Coreum Blockchain**: For tokenized real-world assets
- **XRPL**: For fast, low-cost settlement
- **CosmWasm Smart Contracts**: For bonded auction escrow

## Join the Movement
This is an open-source, collaborative effort to build fair trade in an unfair world.
