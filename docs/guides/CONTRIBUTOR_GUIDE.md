# Contributor Guide: How to Work & Get Funded

## The PhoenixPME Funding Model
This project aims to become self-sustaining through a 1.1% protocol fee, governed by the community. This means contributors are paid via **transparent grants**, not equity or speculative tokens.

## Path for Technical Contributors

### Step 1: Find an Open Task
- Check the active issues in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PhoenixPME/coreum-pme/issues) tab.
- Review the roadmap in [PROJECTS.md](./PROJECTS.md).
- Comment on an issue or discussion to express interest and share your initial thoughts.

### Step 2: Submit a Grant Proposal
For substantial work, you will submit a proposal to the community. A good proposal includes:

1.  **Title & Summary:** e.g., "Build Core Auction Escrow Smart Contract v1.0"
2.  **Detailed Scope of Work:** Reference the specific [State Machine Spec](./docs/diagrams/auction_state_machine.md) sections.
3.  **Deliverables:** Concrete outputs (e.g., "Audited CosmWasm contract on Coreum testnet", "Technical documentation").
4.  **Timeline:** Estimated start date and completion date.
5.  **Grant Request:** Total funding amount and any milestone breakdowns (e.g., "30% on audit completion, 70% on mainnet deployment").
6.  **Your Background:** Links to previous relevant work (GitHub, portfolio).

### Step 3: Community Review & Vote
- Your proposal will be posted to the community forum/Discussion tab.
- Community members and other developers will ask questions and provide feedback.
- Once refined, the proposal will move to an on-chain snapshot vote for funding approval.

### Step 4: Work & Get Paid
- Upon vote approval, the grant amount is locked in the DAO treasury.
- You work publicly, preferably in a fork or branch of the main repo.
- Upon milestone completion, you submit proof of work. A multi-sig of community trustees releases the funds.

## Current Priority Tracks for Grants
1.  **Core Smart Contract Development:** Implementing the auction escrow state machine in CosmWasm.
2.  **Frontend/UI Development:** Building a user-friendly web interface.
3.  **Oracle Development:** Creating the service to verify USPS tracking.
4.  **Cross-Chain Infrastructure:** Building the bridge between Coreum (logic) and XRPL (settlement).
