# PhoenixPME Fee Model

## SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

### Platform Fee: 1.1%
- Applied to successful auction transactions
- 100% allocated to Insurance Pool (RLUSD escrow)
- Developer receives 10% ownership stake in Insurance Pool

### Future Insurance Fee: 2.0%
- Will activate when Insurance Pool reaches 50,000 RLUSD
- 90% to Insurance Pool (risk coverage)
- 10% to Developer (revenue share)

## Implementation
- Fees automatically calculated by smart contracts
- Allocations publicly verifiable on blockchain
- No manual intervention required

## Historical Note
Previous documentation mentioned various percentages (0.03%, 0.5%, etc).
Those were planning documents and have been superseded by this model.

## Current Valid Model: 1.1% → Insurance Pool
