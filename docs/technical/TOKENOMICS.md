# Tokenomics: Initial Thoughts & Design Goals

**Status: Conceptual Discussion Draft**
*This document outlines initial thinking for community discussion. No tokens exist.*

## Purpose of a Governance Token
A `PHNX` token would serve one primary purpose: **governance rights** over the PhoenixPME protocol and its DAO treasury. It is a utility token for steering the project, not a security or profit-sharing instrument.

## Core Design Principles
1.  **User Alignment:** Token distribution should heavily favor active, long-term users of the protocol.
2.  **Sustainable Funding:** The treasury, funded by protocol fees, must ensure long-term development and security.
3.  **Avoid Centralization:** Founders and early contributors should not hold a controlling share.
4.  **Regulatory Clarity:** The token must clearly be a governance utility, not an investment.

## Proposed Distribution Model (For Discussion)
| **Category**               | **Allocation** | **Purpose & Release Schedule**                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community Rewards & Airdrops** | 50%+           | Reward early users, liquidity providers, and community participants. Distributed over years based on trading activity, feedback, and other contributions.      |
| **DAO Treasury**           | 30%            | Controlled by `PHNX` token holders. Used to fund grants, audits, partnerships, and ecosystem development via community vote.                                   |
| **Founders & Early Team**  | 10%            | **Subject to 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff.** Rewards high-risk early work. Vesting ensures long-term commitment.                                           |
| **Coreum/XRPL Ecosystem**  | 10%            | Strategic allocation to partners, advisors, and ecosystem funds to foster integration and support. Potentially subject to vesting.                              |

## How You Would Earn Tokens (Examples)
- **Trading:** Earning points for successful buys and sells on the platform.
- **Liquidity Provision:** Providing liquidity to settlement pairs (e.g., XRP/COREUM bridges).
- **Community Work:** Curating listings, contributing to documentation, moderating forums.
- **Bounty Completion:** Finishing specific technical or community tasks.

## Governance Powers
Holding `PHNX` tokens would allow you to vote on:
1.  **Fee Changes:** Proposals to initiate or adjust the protocol fee (0% → 1.1% → 1.1%).
2.  **Treasury Spending:** All grant proposals and budget allocations.
3.  **Technical Upgrades:** Changes to core protocol parameters or smart contracts.
4.  **Community Initiatives:** Funding for marketing, events, or educational content.

## Next Steps
This is a starting point for discussion. The final tokenomics will be:
1.  Debated publicly in community forums.
2.  Drafted into a formal proposal.
3.  **Implemented only after the core protocol is live, stable, and has a user base.**

**No token sale is planned.** The goal is to *earn* a community through a working product, not to *sell* a concept.
