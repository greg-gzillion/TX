# PhoenixPME Governance

## Current Phase: Bootstrap (Pre-DAO)

During the initial bootstrap phase, governance is intentionally centralized to enable rapid development and iteration.

### Decision Hierarchy
1. **Founder (Greg)** - Final authority on all matters
2. **Technical Advisors** - Architecture review and guidance
3. **Community** - Input via GitHub issues and discussions

### Decision Process
All major decisions documented in GitHub with:
- **Problem statement** - What issue are we solving?
- **Options considered** - What alternatives were evaluated?
- **Decision and rationale** - What we chose and why
- **Implementation plan** - How we'll execute

### Future Evolution
This governance structure will evolve into the DAO framework described in [`docs/technical/DAO_OPERATIONS.md`](docs/technical/DAO_OPERATIONS.md) once the protocol reaches sufficient maturity and usage.

### Transparency
- All decisions documented in public GitHub issues
- Community input welcomed and considered
- Rationale for decisions clearly explained
