# PhoenixPME DAO Operations & Governance

## Core Philosophy
PhoenixPME will be governed by its users through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The protocol's parameters—including any fees—will be transparently proposed, debated, and voted on by token holders.

## Phase 1: Bootstrap & Foundation (Fee: 0%)
- **Objective:** Launch a secure, functional MVP. Acquire the first 100 users and prove the protocol's value.
- **Funding:** Initial development funded by founder bootstrapping and potential ecosystem grants.
- **Governance:** Informal, guided by the founding team and early contributors.
- **Exit Condition:** Move to Phase 2 once consistent monthly trading volume exceeds **$10,000**.

## Phase 2: Sustainable Operations (Proposed Fee: 1.1%)
- **Trigger:** A successful on-chain DAO vote.
- **Fee Structure:** A 1.1% fee applied to the settlement amount of each successful trade.
- **Treasury Allocation (Governed by Vote):**
  - 50%: Security (Smart contract audits, bug bounties)
  - 30%: Protocol Maintenance (Oracle server costs, infrastructure)
  - 20%: Community Initiatives (Grants for tools, education)
- **Governance:** Formal on-chain voting using governance tokens.
- **Goal:** Fund essential security and maintenance to protect user funds.

## Phase 3: Growth & Development (Proposed Fee: 1.1%)
- **Trigger:** A successful on-chain DAO vote, proposed once volume justifies expanded development.
- **Fee Structure:** A 1.1% fee applied to the settlement amount.
- **Treasury Allocation (Example Proposal):**
  - 40%: Development Grants (Payment for building new features)
  - 30%: Security & Operations
  - 20%: Growth & Partnerships
  - 10%: Community Treasury
- **Goal:** Create a self-sustaining ecosystem where builders are paid from value created.

## How Value is Distributed

### Protocol-Level Protections (Immutable)
The smart contracts include two non-negotiable economic protections:
1. **1.1% Protocol Fee**: Automatically routed to the Insurance Pool
2. **Developer Stake**: Original founder (Greg) retains 10% ownership of the Insurance Pool

These are hardcoded at the protocol level and cannot be altered by any governance vote. They compensate the original creator for building the foundation.

### Builder Grants (DAO-Governed)
All other value generated—including future fee revenue, treasury funds, and grants—is governed transparently by the DAO:

1. **Grant Proposal:** Any contributor submits a public proposal with deliverables, timeline, and grant amount
2. **Community Debate:** The proposal is discussed in forums and chat
3. **On-Chain Vote:** Token holders vote to approve or reject funding
4. **Milestone Payouts:** Funds released upon verifiable completion

The founder's protocol-level stake does not give them special voting power over these grants. All builders, including the founder when contributing new work, must go through the same transparent grant process.

## Voting & Tokenomics (Initial Sketch)
- **Governance Token:** `PHNX` (or similar)
- **Distribution:** Designed to align long-term incentives. Initial thoughts:
  - Majority allocated to future users via liquidity mining/participation rewards.
  - Significant portion to a community treasury, governed by the DAO.
  - Founders & early contributors subject to long-term vesting.
- **Voting:** 1 token = 1 vote on snapshot proposals.

## Transparency & Legal Guiding Principles
- The DAO Treasury's holdings and all transactions will be fully visible on-chain.
- Fee changes will only occur via successful community votes.
- The protocol is a utility. The fee funds development and security; it is not an investment return.
